# Used Car Listing coding challenge

Please follow the instructions below very carefully.

## Requirement
Back End: NodeJS

Database: MongoDB or Postgres or any other db to your liking.

Front End: React or Angular

Realtime: GraphQL / Socket.io / redis etc
 
## Server-side
- We've provided some .csv files, please use them to store some details into MongoDB.
- Make a route `/user/login` for user login
- Make a route `/user/register` for user registration 
- Make a route `/car/details` for fetching the details for the car based of selected make, model, and trim.
- It should have some query parameters too:  For eg if I'd like to fetch a list of make: `/car/details?cmd='getMakes'` 
For eg if I'd like to fetch model for make='audi': `/car/details?cmd='getModels'&make="audi"` 
For egif  I'd like to fetch trims for make='audi' and model='A3': `/car/details?cmd='getTrims'&make="audi"&model="A3"` 
Show all these details of trims in the page which is defined in `trim.csv` file.  
## Client-side 
We need a website where the user can search for car details of his desired filter selection.
- We need a login page asking for username and password. 
- Redirect the users to `/cars` page after login:
  - This page should have 3 dropdowns to show all the details of the filtered cars, and a button `Show Data` 
    - make 
    - model
    - trim 
  - By default the page will show only the dropdowns (mentioned above), and only make dropdown will be populated. 
  - After selecting 1 item from the make dropdown, the model dropdown should get populated (list will come from an api call). 
  - Then after selecting 1 item from the model dropdown, then the trim dropdown should get populated (list will come from an api call) 
And so on…..
  - At last, clicking on the “Show Data” button, should show the details (defined in the provided `trim.csv` file)
  - We also want a toggle to show the list into grid view or list view. 

##### VERY IMPORTANT (DO NOT MISS THIS)
  - There should be a button to navigate it to `/admin` route. From admin page only admin user could add new car details; it should be done in a way when we add a new car detail first validate the user authentication whether its an  admin or non-admin user. **(Use JWT token for auth)** 

  - When admin user is adding a new car detail, then it should be **real-time (Preferably GraphQL, socket.io).** To do that, add a new detail in a browser and check in another browser without reloading the page whether you can see the newly added car details or not.
